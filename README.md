# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Overview

Welcome to my Rock Paper Scissors game project! This project is a simple and interactive implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The goal was to practice and demonstrate skills in JavaScript and create a fun, engaging game.

## Features

- **Player vs Computer Mode:** Play against the computer with randomized moves.
- **Interactive UI:** Clickable buttons to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- **Game Feedback:** Displays the result of each round and keeps track of the score.
- **Responsive Design:** The game adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For structuring the game layout.
- **CSS3:** For styling the game interface.
- **JavaScript:** For game logic and interactivity.

## Challenges and Learnings

Creating this Rock Paper Scissors game involved several challenges, especially in implementing the game logic to handle user inputs and determine the game outcome. This project helped me improve my JavaScript skills, particularly in working with event listeners and updating the DOM dynamically.

## Future Improvements

- **Multiplayer Mode:** Allow two players to play against each other on the same device.
- **Enhanced UI:** Add animations and transitions to make the game more visually appealing.
- **Score Persistence:** Save scores between sessions using localStorage.
